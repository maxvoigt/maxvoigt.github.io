I’m a PhD student in financial economis at the Frankfurt School, and a research assistant at the Chair of Economic Theory I (Sebastian Ebert) at Heidelberg University. Prior to my doctoral studies, I worked at different investment banks and studied financial economics at the University of Oxford. 

I will be participating in the 2023-2024 academic job market.

Job Market Paper — Asset pricing under selective memory
------
I analyze the effect of selective and stochastic memory on asset prices. In line with evidence from psychology, I consider an agent who is more likely to remember some experiences than others (selective memory), while the recall of any experience is probabilistic. Selective memory provides an empirically relevant alternative to time-varying risk-aversion, disaster risk, or long-run risk as explanation for asset pricing puzzles.
