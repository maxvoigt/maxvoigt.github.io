I’m a PhD student in financial economics at the Frankfurt School, and a research assistant at the Chair of Economic Theory I (Sebastian Ebert) at Heidelberg University. Prior to my doctoral studies, I worked at different investment banks and studied financial economics at the University of Oxford. 

I will be participating in the 2023-2024 academic job market.

Job Market Paper — Asset pricing under selective memory
------
I analyze the effect of selective and stochastic memory on asset prices. In line with evidence from psychology, I consider an agent who is more likely to remember some experiences than others (selective memory), while the recall of any experience is probabilistic. Selective memory provides an empirically relevant alternative to time-varying risk-aversion, disaster risk, or long-run risk as explanation for asset pricing puzzles.

Eliciting Stopping Times (with [Sebastian Ebert](https://sites.google.com/site/ebertecon/home)) [[Link to SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4526931)]
  <details style="margin-top:-1em"><summary>Abstract</summary>We propose an experimental method to elicit stopping times—each subject’s complete contingent plan for taking a risk for up to five times—to study repeated risk-taking under precommitment. In addition to time- and outcome-contingent risk-taking, we allow some subjects to use path-dependent or randomized stopping times. Our experimental design thus allows for hundreds of different risk-taking plans. Using an unsupervised machine-learning algorithm, we find that individuals’ risk-taking strategies map well to stop-loss, take-profit, or buy-and-hold strategies. Most strategies are of a continue-when-winning and stop-when-losing type, with a profit-trailing stopping barrier. Path-dependence and randomization are used extensively, even if they are costly. We further analyze dynamic consistency in a sequential risk-taking task and find that subjects largely follow the unconstrained plans that we elicited.
