I’m a PhD student in financial economics at the Frankfurt School, and a research assistant at the Chair of Economic Theory I (Sebastian Ebert) at Heidelberg University. Prior to my doctoral studies, I worked at different investment banks and studied financial economics at the University of Oxford. 

I will be participating in the 2023-2024 academic job market.

Job Market Paper — Investor beliefs and asset prices under selective memory
------
Evidence in economics and psychology emphasizes the central role of selective memory for belief formation. Motivated by these findings, I propose a consumption-based asset pricing model in which the representative agent forms Bayesian beliefs based on selectively recalled observations of fundamentals. I demonstrate that <i>similarity</i>—the selective recall of past fundamentals that are similar to today's fundamental—captures procyclical and overreacting expectations, countercyclical subjective volatility, and a low volatility of the subjective risk premium. The objective risk premium, on the contrary, is predictably countercyclical, volatile, and unrelated to objective risk measures. In addition, I show how my framework can be used to analyze further memory distortions by considering an extreme experience bias.

Eliciting Stopping Times (with [Sebastian Ebert](https://sites.google.com/site/ebertecon/home)) [[Link to SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4526931)]
  <details style="margin-top:-1em"><summary>Abstract</summary>We propose an experimental method to elicit stopping times—each subject’s complete contingent plan for taking a risk for up to five times—to study repeated risk-taking under precommitment. In addition to time- and outcome-contingent risk-taking, we allow some subjects to use path-dependent or randomized stopping times. Our experimental design thus allows for hundreds of different risk-taking plans. Using an unsupervised machine-learning algorithm, we find that individuals’ risk-taking strategies map well to stop-loss, take-profit, or buy-and-hold strategies. Most strategies are of a continue-when-winning and stop-when-losing type, with a profit-trailing stopping barrier. Path-dependence and randomization are used extensively, even if they are costly. We further analyze dynamic consistency in a sequential risk-taking task and find that subjects largely follow the unconstrained plans that we elicited.
